### This Site

Hi! I'm Charis, a psychology undergraduate at NUS. This website serves as a visual outlet for demonstrating various topics covered in the NM2207 "Computational Media Literacy" course, with the goal of visualising specific waste features and patterns in Singapore from 2003 to 2017. It has the potential to reveal and inform on the state of recycling and energy savings.

### Data Set

This application makes use of two datasets, both retrieved from Emin Basturk Kaggle page, "Singapore NEA Energy Savings". These two datasets, 'Waste Statistics' and 'Energy Saved' were selected not only to illustrate recycling rates for various materials, but also to reveal findings such as the differential efficiency of certain materials in terms of energy savings while recycling.
