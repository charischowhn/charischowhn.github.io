title: "Waste Management in Singapore"
---

### Introduction

Singapore launched the Zero Waste Masterplan in 2019 to address waste issues and resource management in a land-scarce nation. With the rising amount of waste disposed of over the last 40 years, the Semakau Landfill is expected to run out of space by 2035, so the government has been ramping up its efforts to promote recycling among Singaporeans.

Most Singaporeans recycle only through the blue bin outside their homes. For them, the blue bins provide a convenient way to recycle their daily waste - a one-stop shop where we can all drop our recyclables without having to sort them out. The blue bins have been around since April 2001, when they were introduced as part of the National Environment Agency's (NEA) National Recycling Programme. This visualisation hence seeks to reveal the features and patterns of recycling in Singapore from 2003 to 2017 as well as the energy saved from recycling.

### I. Lack of public education on domestic recycling despite increasing waste

##### *Visualisation #1 and #2*

In general, the first bar graph depicts the increasing trend of waste generated over the years, which could be attributed to the growing population size in Singapore from 2003 to 2017.

To investigate the recycling efforts in Singapore, I plotted the second box plot, which highlights how the mean waste recycled over the years did not change much despite the launch of many recycling campaigns such as "Bloobin" in 2003. This highlights the lack of public education in Singapore on how to recycle as people "had been treating the blue recycling bins as trash bins, throwing all sorts of rubbish into them and causing recyclables to be contaminated" (Clean & Green Singapore, 2023).

However, it should be noted that since 2019, the Singapore government has launched other campaigns to help Singaporeans understand how to recycle properly (NEA, 2022). As such, it should be noted that while these visualisations provide a sense of the recycling scene in Singapore, it may not accurately reflect the current state or predict recycling trends in Singapore today.

### II. Non-domestic recycling rates fare better than domestic recycling

##### *Visualisation #3*

From this bar graph, it can be observed that the main bulk of the increase of materials recycled comes from the increase in recycling of "Others" and of "Ferrous Metals". This is reflected by how Singapore has seen success in recycling 99% of its construction and demolition waste, listed under "others" as well as 99% of ferrous metals since 2013 (Vishnoi, 2023). There are many other waste types within the "Others" category but due to the nature of this application, we do not seek to expound on the details.

This trend continues in 2022 where the non-domestic recycling rate stands at 72% while domestic recycling rate stands at a stark contrast of 12% (NEA, 2023). This disparity between domestic and non-domestic recycling rates underscores the effectiveness of specialized recycling programs, particularly in the industrial sector. The success story of recycling construction and demolition waste and ferrous metals highlights the potential for targeted approaches to yield substantial results in resource recovery.

### III. Maximise energy savings by targeting recycling efforts for specific materials

##### *Visualisation #4*

This scatter plot depicts the energy savings and amount of waste recycled based on the type of waste. The following analysis will be broken down into the five different types of waste - glass, plastic, ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal, and paper.

Although the amount of glass recycled increased over the years, the amount of energy saved did not fluctuate much. While glass recycling does save energy compared with using virgin materials, it saves much less energy per ton of glass than other materials such as steel and aluminium (William-Derry, 2006). Likewise, the energy saved from recycling plastic is relatively low especially since the quality of plastic degrades each time the material is down-cycled (Daugherty, 2024).

Despite the fact that ferrous metal is recycled at a larger scale greater than non-ferrous metal, recycling non-ferrous metal saves more energy. This is due to the fact that non-ferrous metals can be recycled continuously as they do not degrade or lose any chemical qualities during the recycling process as opposed to ferrous metals, which must be "melted, purified, and then compacted into solid blocks" (SL Recycling, 2023).

For every tonne of recycled paper, 17 mature trees, 463 gallons of oil, and 7000 water gallons are saved (Green Tumble, 2018). Producing recycled paper also require 60% of the energy used to make new paper from fresh wood pulp, thus the energy savings from paper is great.

The analysis of energy savings further underscores the importance of strategic resource allocation in recycling endeavors. While certain materials like paper demonstrate significant energy savings potential, others such as glass and plastic pose challenges due to their limited energy efficiency in recycling processes. This calls for continued research and innovation.

### Conclusion

Moving forward, Singapore must adopt a holistic approach that integrates targeted public education, industry-specific interventions, and technological innovations to advance its waste management agenda. Public education campaigns should be tailored to address the specific recycling challenges and habits prevalent in domestic settings, emphasizing the importance of proper sorting and disposal practices.

Simultaneously, continued investment in research and innovation is paramount to overcoming the challenges posed by materials with limited energy efficiency in recycling processes. Initiatives like NTU's improved photocatalytic reaction for plastic waste management demonstrate the potential for breakthrough technologies to revolutionize waste treatment methods, reducing energy consumption and environmental impact.

By embracing these strategies and fostering collaboration across sectors, Singapore can reinforce its position as a global leader in environmental sustainability. Through collective action and innovation, the nation can forge a path towards a truly sustainable, zero-waste future, ensuring the preservation of its precious resources for generations to come.
