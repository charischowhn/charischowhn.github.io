### Charis Chow
Charis is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Psychology at the National University of Singapore. Coupled with her interest in trauma psychology and a heart for the marginalised, particularly women and children who have been a victim of crime, she has been actively involved in both volunteering in her community and in research projects. This website provides a visual outlet to document the trends that she notices in mental health.
